!!! pied-piper ":bulb: TL;DR - Working Software, Now"

      Agile correctly advises getting Working Software as fast as possible, to faciliate Business User Collaboration and Iteration.  API Logic Server help you achieve this:

      1. **Instant Working Software:** API Logic Server creates an API, and Admin screens

      2. **Publish to GitHub:** for dev team collaboration

      3. **Deploy for *Collaboration:*** automated cloud deployment enables collaboration:
      
         * Engage Business Users with running Admin screens - spot data model misunderstandings, and uncover logic requirements
         * Unblock UI Developers with the API

      4. **Iterate with *logic:*** use [declarative rules](../Logic-Why) for logic and [security](../Security-Overview), extensible with Python as required.  Rules are a unique aspect of API Logic Server:
      
         * logic is 40X more concise, and 
         * automatically ordered per system-discovered dependencies, to facilite rapid iteration

      With API Logic Server, if you have a database, you can create and deploy for collaboration ***within an hour***.

      Use the [Deployment Tutorial](../Tutorial-Deployment) to see the complete cycle of creation through deployment.  Examples are provided for MySQL and Postgres.  No install - docker databases are pre-supplied.

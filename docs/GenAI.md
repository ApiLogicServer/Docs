!!! pied-piper ":bulb: TL;DR - Create Microservice from Natural Language Prompt Using website"

    API Logic Server / GenAI is a [website]() that accepts a Natural Language prompt (e.g, CRM system), and produces:

    * a Microservice: an Admin App and a JSON:API
    * a project you can download and customize in your IDE using rules and python
    * deploy as a container using automatically generated scripts.

    API Logic Server / GenAI uses:
    
    * GenAI services for data model creation, and 
    * API Logic Server for project creation.

    Developers can also use GenAI services on their own machine using the [GenAI CLI](GenAI-CLI.md){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
    

## Example

Enter a prompt describing the system you have in mind:

![create](images/web_genai/create.png)

The system creates and executes this multi-page application and API.  It is live, including test data, so can evalute your business idea and iterate.

![run](images/web_genai/run.png)



## Develop

You can explore the created microservice on your own computer.

1. [Download]() your project (customize in your IDE to add logic & security)

    * Observe the project is a set of [models]() - not a huge pile of difficult-to-understand code

2. Executable Docker Image

    * The website provides a docker command to run the created project.

<summary>2. Customize - Declarative Rules and Python in your IDE</summary>

The speed and simplicity of AI, plus all the flexibility of a framework.  

* Download the standard project, and [**customize in your IDE**](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Tutorial/#3-customize-and-debug-in-your-ide)

* Use standard Python: e.g. provide [Application integration](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Sample-Integration/) (custom APIs and kafka messaging) 

* [Declarative security](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Security-Overview/): configure keycloak authentication, declare role-based row authorization<br>

* [Declarative business logic](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Logic-Why/): multi-table constraints and derivations using ***unique rules*** that are 40X more concise than code, extensible with Python<br>

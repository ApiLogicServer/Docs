      * WebGenAI-focused
      * Java background - new to Python

## Initial Background
Review the [GenAI Architecture](Architecture-What-Is-GenAI.md){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and take a quick scan of [Python for Java programmers](Tech-Python.md){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Make sure you are clear on the `venv`.

## Core Lab

1. Create a project (genai demo)
2. Iterate: get suggestions, correct them
3. Download
4. Debug: log and debugger (stop in constraint)
    * Open downloaded project, set venv

&nbsp;

## Customizing with Python

1. Creating custom endpoint

2. Custom logic
3. Data Model Classes (attr/reln accessors) - Python â€˜beans'

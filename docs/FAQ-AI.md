## TL;DR - AI... with business-oriented models

AI has proven to be a powerful tool for automating function-level coding.  However, creating complete sub-systems is less successful, requiring language input for low-level implementation details.  These require substantial skill (e.g., detailed knowledge of a framework), and result in systems that are difficult to maintain.   

By introducing high-level ***business-oriented language***, it becomes possible to create complete systems.  API Logic Server uses AI to create complete systems from high-level business logic, without requiring detailed language input.  

These systems are then maintained at a high level of abstraction through created executable models.  The resultant systems are easy to maintain, and extend where necessary using standard languages and tools.  This approach is unique in the industry, and has been proven in a wide range of applications.

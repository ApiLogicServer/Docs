!!! pied-piper ":bulb: TL;DR - *Agile Integrations* with Instant, Logic-Enforced, Consumer-Defined APIs"

    Many organizations still employ ETL (Extract, Transfer and Load) approaches for integrations.  These are costly non-agile projects, inefficient, and operationally clumsy.

    API Logic Server enables ***Agile Integrations:***

    * **Instant API** creation

        * Eliminates ad hoc projects to write and deploy ETL services

        * Eliminates complex DevOps procedures to run nightly ETL executions

        * Eliminates inefficient Extract runs, replacing them with lightweight API calls that return current data

    * **Logic-Enforced** APIs ensure that such accesses are subjected to security, and maintain data integrity

    * JSON:APIs are **consumer-defined**, ensuring client organizations to **self-service**, without requiring ad hoc API development for each new integration

!!! pied-piper ":bulb: AI-Driven Automation Delivers the Agile Vision"

      Agile wisely advises getting Working Software as fast as possible, to facilitate Business User Collaboration and Iteration.  ChatGPT and API Logic Server deliver this vision, with 1 hour project cycles:

      1. **Start with an existing SQL database**
      2. **Create Working Software *Now* with API Logic Server:**

          * **Self-serve API:** ready for UI Dev, no custom server dev required
          * **Admin App:** ready for Business User collaboration
      3. **Deploy for *Collaboration* with API Logic Server:** e.g. to the Azure Cloud
      4. **Iterate:** using:
          * **Rules:** 40X more concise than code for the backend *half* of your system
          * **Python:** as required for complete flexibility

      This process **leverages your existing IT infrastructure:** your IDE, GitHub, the cloud, your databaseâ€¦ open source.

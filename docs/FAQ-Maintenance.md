While rapid project creation is valuable and striking, experience has taught us that maintenance costs outweigh initial coding.  Only then is business agility materially improved.

> So, it's appropriate to ask whether Microservice Automation addresses maintance.

It does.

Declarative rules play a significant role in iterative development with support for **maintenance automation:**

* Rule are **automically invoked, and ordered.**  So, unlike code, you can add/alter rules without worrying about where to place them so they run, and in the proper order, with automatic chaining (dependency management).

* Rules are **automatically optimized,** reducing SQLs by pruning and adjustment-based aggregates.

* Debug rules using the IDE **debugger,** and the **logic trace,** which shows which rules fire.

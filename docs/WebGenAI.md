!!! pied-piper ":bulb: TL;DR - Create a running system from a Natural Language prompt - zero install"

    Provide a **prompt**, and you have **instant working software:** database and API-based Web App.
    
    * Far faster and simpler than frameworks, or Low Code database designers and screen painters.

    **Collaborate** with your colleagues.  It's on the web.  Just submit another prompt and **iterate.**

    **Build-out** your system by downloading the complete running project.

    1. **Standard tools:** your IDE, Python, GitHub, and libraries like Flask and SQLAlchemy <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(e.g., add Kafka for Application Integration)

    2. Declare **spreadsheet-like rules** for logic and security - [***40x***](Logic-Why.md){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} more concise than code &nbsp; :trophy:

    3. Create **containers** using supplied scripts, and deploy anywhere and scale

## How does it work

![how does it work](images/web_genai/how-does-it-work.png)

Web/GenAI

1. Uses GenAI APIs to create databases
2. Uses API Logic Server to create projects from databases
3. Provides services to deploy and run the create projects

Gen/AI is used only in step 1, so once created, projects are stable and do not exhibit AI *hallunications*.

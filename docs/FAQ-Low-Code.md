API Logic Server is a Low Code approach for creating database systems.

There are many excellent low-code products that focus on User Interfaces.

API Logic Server differs from these with a no-compromise Enterprise / Developer focus:

* Strong focus on __backend logic,__ with unique rules

* Uses your __existing tooling: IDE. languages, libraries, deployment, etc__

* Creates admin apps even faster - automatically, no screen painting required

* AI-based database and rules creation

The API Logic server Admin App is designed for instant Agile collaboration, and back office data maintenance.  For richer applications, utilize the automated API.  Importantly, this dramatically simplifies UI development since the API encapsulates business logic.

The following table contrasts traditional "Business User" Low Code with "Developer" Low Code:

| **Aspect** | ***Business User* Low Code**  | ***Developer* Low Code** |
:-------|:-----------|:-----------|
| Screen Painter | **Commonly Provided** | Not Provided |
| Customizations | Proprietary Studio | Standard IDE |
| Rich UI | Via Screen Painter | **Declarative App Models** |
| Instant Working Software<br>for Agile Collaboration | Can be tedious | **Instant Automation** |
| Database Creation | Via Forms - Can be complicated | **Gen AI** Natural Language |
| Business Logic | Code (if provided) | **Declarative Rules** |

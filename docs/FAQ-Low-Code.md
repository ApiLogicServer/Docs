## TL;DR - a Low Code approach for creating database systems

API Logic Server is a Low Code approach for creating database systems, particularly those providing transactional updates.

There are many excellent low-code products that focus on User Interfaces.

API Logic Server differs from these with a no-compromise Enterprise / Developer focus:

* __GenAI-based__ database and rules creation

* Strong focus on __backend logic,__ with unique rules

* Uses your __existing tooling: IDE. languages, libraries, deployment, etc__

    * This "Dev / IT friendly" approach can help promote Low Code adoption more widely in their organizations

* __Automated Modern Software Architeture__ - APIs, Messages, Logic Sharing

* __Promotes Agile__ with Working Software, Instantly

    * Creates admin apps even faster - automatically, no screen painting required

    * Enables early discovery of misunderstood requirements, incomplete business concept

The API Logic server Admin App is designed for instant Agile collaboration, and back office data maintenance.  For richer applications, utilize the automated API.  Importantly, this dramatically simplifies UI development since the API encapsulates business logic.

The following table contrasts traditional "Business User" Low Code with "Developer" Low Code:

| **Aspect** | ***Business User* Low Code**  | ***Developer* Low Code** |
:-------|:-----------|:-----------|
| Screen Painter | **Commonly Provided** | Not Provided |
| Customizations | Proprietary Studio | Standard IDE |
| Rich UI | Via Screen Painter | **Declarative App Models** |
| Instant Working Software<br>for Agile Collaboration | Can be tedious | **Instant App Automation**<br>No Screen Painting Required |
| Database Creation | Via Forms <br>Can be complicated | **Gen AI** Natural Language<br>Break-through simplicity |
| Business Logic<br>(It's nearly half the system) | Proprietary Code<br>Procedural | **Unique Spreadsheet-like Rules**<br>Declarative - 40X More Concise |
| Architecture | Proprietary - rigid | **Automated Microservice**<br>**Standard Docker**<br>**Flexibile: Cloud, Internal** |

API Logic Server is a Low Code approach for creating database systems.

There are many excellent low-code products that focus on User Interfaces.

API Logic Server differs from these with a no-compromise Enteprise / Developer focus:

* Strong focus on __backend logic,__ with unique rules

* Uses your __existing tooling: IDE. languages, libraries, deployment, etc__

* Creates admin apps even faster - automatically, no screen painting required

* AI-based creation

The API Logic server Admin App is designed for instant Agile collaboration, and back office data maintenance.  For richer applications, utilize the automated API.  Importantly, this dramatically simplifies UI development since the API encapsulates business logic.

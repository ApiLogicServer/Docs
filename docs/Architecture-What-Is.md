!!! pied-piper ":bulb: TL;DR - modern 3-tiered architecture, API-accessed, scalable containers"

    **Deployment Architecture**

    * A modern 3-tiered architecture, accessed by **APIs**
    * Logic is **automatically reused**, factored out of web apps and custom services
    * **Containerized** for scalable cloud deployment - the project includes a dockerfile to containerize it to DockerHub.

    **Development Architecture**

    * Installed as Docker, `pip`, or use Codespaces
    * **Standards-based customization** - debug in a standard IDE (VSCode, PyCharm), using standard packages (Flask, SQLAlchemy)


## Runtimes and CLI

API Logic Server is a Python Application, consisting of:

1. __Runtimes__ for ApiLogicProject execution (see below)
2. __CLI__ (Command Language Interface - provides `ApiLogicServer create `â€¦`)

It executes either as a locally install (venv), or a Docker image (which includes Python).  In either case, the contents are the same:

## Key Runtime Components

## Model Execution Engines

When you create a project (`als create` or `als genai`), the system creates models shown below.  These model files are "executed" by the corresponding **Model Execution Engines**, as noted.

This *model driven* approach has substantial advantages, as described below.

&nbsp;

### Maintainable

In traditional framework-based implementations, the amount of code required is massive.  The last thing you want to take a high level of abstraction turned into low level code you need to understand and maintain.

By way of analogy, you would not want a compiler to generate machine code, and then have to maintain the machine code.

&nbsp;

### Platform Independent

Given rapid technology advancement, it is strategic advantage to preserve IT investment over such change.  That is simply impossible if there is massive code that is technology-depedent.

By contrast, the models can be translated into different languages and architectures.

This is not a thoeretical propistion.  In fact, past implementations of this techology have proved the migration:

* from minicomputers to Visual Basic to J2EE

* from JavaScript to Python

## Execution: 3-tiered architecture

The API Logic Server executes as an application server, accessed by an API, in a standard 3-tiered architecture.  

Observe that logic plugs into SQLAlchemy.  **Logic is thus automatically shared** (factored out) of custom services, and web or browser-based apps.

In most cases, the API Logic Server executes in a **container**, so scales horizontally like any other Flask-based server.

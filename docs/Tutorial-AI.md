      2. **Create Working Software *Now* with API Logic Server:**

          * Creates executable, customizable projects from databases
          * Declare logic logic and security with spreadsheet-like rules using your IDE
      3. **Deploy for *Collaboration* with API Logic Server:** e.g. to the Azure Cloud
      4. **Iterate:** add additional rules, with Python as required

      This process **leverages your existing IT infrastructure:** your IDE, GitHub, the cloud, your databaseâ€¦ open source.

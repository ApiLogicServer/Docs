# Welcome to GenAI-Logic
_By Val Huber, Sep 2025_

## Big Vision

As AI accelerates change, business agility has never been more important.
Our IT systems must keep up:
It Should Be As Simple to Create a System as It Is to Imagine It
potential impact.


## Big Problem

But that impact is held up by a big problem:
Nearly half the effort in an IT system is the backend — the logic, the
integration.
But GenAI technology — on its own — turns a simple 5 line logic
requirement into 200 lines of FrankenCode. And it’s buggy.
maintain the byte code of your compiler.
We want to maintain the high level of abstraction of natural language.


## Big Solution

So, this means:
We should not be asking GenAI to explode our 5 lines of logic into 200
lines of procedural code.
We should be asking GenAI to translate our 5 lines of logic into rigorous,
executable code at the same level of abstraction — just executable. That’s
Declarative GenAI.
It’s unique to GenAI-Logic. And it looks like this:
Declarative GenAI translates 5 lines of logic into 5 lines of executable code, executable via the
Declarative Rules Engine. NOT 200 lines of FrankenCode.
This is the missing half of GenAI, enabling it to close the adoption gap for GenAI.

## Complete Enterprise Platform

# But declarative logic is just the foundation. GenAI-Logic provides a complete
enterprise platform:


## Declarative Automation



## Works With What You Have

modernize existing databases. In one minute, wrap any legacy database with
a modern API, declarative business logic, and MCP integration. No rip-and-
replace required.
Enterprise Performance Traditional RETE engines and ORMs recalculate
aggregates unconditionally, using expensive queries that slow down as data
grows. Our engine prunes logic when it’s not required, and uses an
adjustment pattern approach to update incrementally. These have delivered
constant regardless of database size.
Automatic Governance Requirements traceability isn’t a feature we added —
it’s built into the architecture. Natural language scenarios become
executable rules that are transparent to business users. Run tests and get
automatic documentation showing exactly which rules implemented which
requirements, with complete execution logs. Auditors can trace any
requirement from intent to execution.


## True Business-IT Collaboration

vision: “a unified technology stack where business users can kick start
systems that can be handed off to IT to complete as required.” That’s exactly
what we built. Business users create working systems in minutes, iterate to
get requirements right, then hand off standard Python projects to IT for
completion.
Big Impact: Organizational Business Agility
This is more than developer productivity. It’s organizational business agility:
business and IT collaborating on systems that can evolve as fast as the
business itself.
Unlike traditional low-code tools that often pit business users against IT,
# GenAI-Logic enables true collaboration — business users draft, IT refines,
and the system stays governable. We can now:
to get the requirements right:
First Draft of a System — this runs, ready to collaborate / iterate to get requirements right
This creates an executable system in about a minute — web app, api with
logic, and database:
The Prompt above creates a Database, a User Interface, and an API with Swagger
2. Developers can (as required) download the project to finish it off. For
more information, click here. They can vibe custom UIs, in minutes, that
leverage the APIs and logic:
Developers can use Vibe to create Custom User Interfaces
3. Developers can add MCP support — including logic — to existing
databases, which in turn enables Business Users to compose their own
services that adhere to organizational policies.
Both scenarios depend on Declarative GenAI logic, unique to GenAI-Logic.
Proviso: No Automation Tax
OK… but to get this technology, we should not be required to lose the value
of our existing tools and methodologies. Achieving the full potential requires
it should leverage our existing IDEs (such as Copilot), source code
management, testing, deployment, monitoring, etc.
Developers can Customize Logic and APIs with their Favorite Tools

adoption gap that has stalled enterprise AI by making business logic — half the
project effort — declarative, governable, and real.

# The Missing Half of GenAI — and Why Microsoft’s CEO Says It’s the Future

### Introducing Declarative GenAI - A 3-Part Series

**Love Your GenAI Tools? You’re Missing the Half That Matters Most.**

GenAI vibe tools like Cursor, v0, and Bolt are incredible at creating beautiful UIs. But here’s what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently predicted: the future business app is just a *“thin UI over a bunch of business logic,”* managed by agents.

Current GenAI tools are excellent at the thin UI. But they don’t yet address the business logic layer — the part Nadella says matters most.

That’s where Declarative GenAI comes in — the missing half that completes the future.

## The Gap in Today’s GenAI

We love the GenAI vibe tools too, but they’re only part way to the future Nadella described:

- **Baseline (pre-AI):** 100 units of effort  
- **Current GenAI (thin UI only):** 56 units of effort  
- **Declarative GenAI (UI + Business Logic):** 20 units of effort  

We’re leaving major productivity gains on the table — and missing the entire business logic layer that delivers the value.

AI-only vibe tools stop at the UI — Declarative GenAI adds the business logic, reducing total effort by 80%.

## Where Current Tools Hit the Wall

I tested our standard enterprise prompt – shown above – across the popular GenAI vibe tools. The results were clear:

- Subtle corner-case bugs, buried in hundreds of lines of unmaintainable *FrankenCode*  
- Often dumped on the client side  
- This fails to adhere to service-oriented architecture (SOA) principles that seek to share logic for reuse and automated invocation  

This isn’t the fast path to enterprise-ready business logic — it’s instant tech debt that creates a maintenance burden.

## The Missing Half: Business Logic Agents

The future Nadella described requires declarative business logic that is:

- **Natural Language** – business users and developers provide logic requirements in natural language  
- **Governable** – no AI hallucinations; implements your requirements exactly  
- **Maintainable** – self-documenting code that looks like the requirements, easy to maintain  
- **Enterprise-ready** – proper architecture, not logic embedded in client-side hacks

## The Missing Half: Declarative GenAI

When used with GenAI-Logic, the same prompt shown above produces exactly what Nadella described:

- **Real generated code** – extend in your IDE  
- **What you get:** complete database, admin UI, REST API, and integrations — all implementing your business logic exactly as specified  
- **Time:** 1 minute for a complete, future-ready system  

The critical difference is the use of Declarative GenAI for the business logic half of the system:

- Declarative GenAI: *5 rules, clean, transparent, and enterprise-ready*  
- Procedural GenAI: *200+ lines of brittle FrankenCode*  

**[INSERT FrankenCode vs. Declarative Rules Graphic]**

There’s no hallucination, because Declarative GenAI is translating your logic, not making up its own. The resultant Domain Specific Language (DSL) code is executed at runtime by the Declarative Rules Engine, operating as an ORM listener. This runtime (non-RETE) engine is a sophisticated piece of software, providing automatic invocation, dependency-based ordering, and optimization.

## Declarative GenAI: Complete Your Favorite Tools

This isn’t about replacing the GenAI tools you love for UI development. It’s about completing them with the missing half:

- Keep using Cursor/v0/Bolt for the “thin UI” layer  
- Add Declarative GenAI for enterprise-ready business logic  
- Deploy systems that actually work in enterprise environments  

The result? **80% less total effort** and applications ready for the future Nadella described.

## Coming Up in This Series

- **Part 2:** Business User / IT Collaboration – how business users can create enterprise logic themselves, iterate to get the requirements right, then hand off working systems to IT  
- **Part 3:** Living with Logic – logic management and debugging using your existing IDE, and deployment via standard containers

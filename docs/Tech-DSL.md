!!! pied-piper ":bulb: TL;DR - Use Python (code completion) to declare behavior"

    Declarative specifications are captured in Python, providing:

    * Natural source control, code review etc.

    * Type Checking, based on IDE support for Python typing

    * Lookups, based on IDE support for Code Completion


Declarative is a powerful technology, designed to provide agility and transparency with high level definitions.  Such definitions comprise a DSL - a Domain Specific Language.  This article explores how such language elements are captured and stored.

## API Logic Server Declarative

API Logic Server provides declarative support for:

* API - the `api/expose_api_models.py` file declares (lists) which tables are exposed in the [API](../API).

* Logic - using spreadsheet-like rules - [see here for more information](../Logic-Why).

* User Interface - using a yaml file  - [see here for more information](../Admin-Customization).

## Capture with a User Interface

Declarations are more valuable 

### Advantage: type checking, lookups

### Store as database?

### Store as markup language?

## Capture as Python Code

### Type Checking, Code Completion

### Storage is inherent

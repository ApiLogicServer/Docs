### Title
**GenAI-Logic — Enterprise Vibe Automation**

### Subtitle
Natural-language system creation, deterministic execution,  
and governed AI — packaged as a **Business Logic Agent** (your logic appliance).

### Tagline
The missing half of GenAI:  
AI provides intent and reasoning; deterministic logic ensures correctness, safety, and compliance.

### Proposed Visual

Natural Language in IDE
  - User intent in plain English

AI Assistant
  - Translates intent → Declarative Logic (DL + PL)

Deterministic Logic Engine
  - Correctness • Ordering • Propagation • 40× concise

Business Logic Agent
  - Governed execution • Standard API • MCP-ready

Your Enterprise Systems
  - Database • API • Events • Integrations

### Optional Visual (Storyboard)
1. NL prompt → GenAI-Logic → Business Logic Agent  
2. BLA → MCP → Your enterprise systems  
3. Caption: *A governed logic appliance for AI-driven enterprises*

## Declarative GenAI  
### Summary
GenAI-Logic transforms natural language into enterprise-grade systems.

NL describes *what must be true* — not how to compute it.  
GenAI-Logic captures that intent, generates deterministic rules (DL) and probabilistic handlers (PL), and executes them with a governed rules engine.

Declarative logic removes procedural glue-code, reduces complexity,  
and avoids “Franken-responses” that hide logic across controller code.

This is the beginning of a **Business Logic Agent** — logic you can read, trust, and evolve.

### Slides  
(Storyboard)
- **Slide 1:** NL → Declarative Logic  
  - Visual: NL statement (“The Customer’s balance is the sum of open orders”)  
  - Caption: *Natural language is already declarative.*

- **Slide 2:** Procedural vs Declarative  
  - Split-screen: 200 lines of code vs 5 declarative rules  
  - Caption: *40× more concise. 80% less effort.*

- **Slide 3:** GenAI-Logic Architecture  
  - Diagram: NL → GenAI → DSL + PL → Deterministic Engine  
  - Caption: *AI generates; the engine guarantees correctness.*

- **Slide 4:** Declarative Engine Execution  
  - Multi-table propagation, constraints, events  
  - Caption: *Deterministic behavior you can trust.*

## Automatic Backend  
### Summary
GenAI-Logic instantly produces a working backend:  
a full **JSON:API**, **MCP-discoverable**, and ready for AI orchestration.

Start from a real database — or create one from natural-language description.  
No mock data. No boilerplate. No manual schema stitching.

Your backend becomes a **logic appliance**, ready to plug into your enterprise architecture.

## Automatic App  
### Summary
Why start from scratch?  
GenAI-Logic automatically generates a working multi-page application:

- Admin UI  
- Declarative navigation and layouts  
- Responds dynamically to schema and logic  
- Can be customized using your favorite **Vibe tools**

This is not a toy mockup — it is a real, running app connected to the governed backend.

  - Screenshot: Admin UI running on real data  
  - Caption: *Real app. Real backend. Zero scaffolding.*

- **Slide 2:** Custom React App (Vibe)  
  - Visual: prompts → updated app views

## Declarative Business Logic 🏆  
### Summary
Business logic is half the effort — and the part AI struggles with most.

GenAI-Logic solves this by generating:

- **Deterministic Logic (DL):** sums, formulas, constraints, events  
- **Probabilistic Logic (PL):** structured LLM calls for intelligent choices  

Both run inside the **Business Logic Agent**, where deterministic rules govern every operation.

Rules are concise, explainable, and kept out of the UI.  
The engine ensures multi-table propagation, constraint checking, and correctness.

### Slides  
(Storyboard)
- **Slide 1:** NL → DSL (DL)  
  - Example: Check Credit rules  
  - Caption: *5 lines of logic → full business policy.*

- **Slide 2:** PL Event Handler  
  - Example: Supplier selection (AI handler)  
  - Caption: *AI for choices; engine for correctness.*

- **Slide 3:** Deterministic Runtime  
  - Diagram: R1 (DL) → optional R2 (PL) → Commit  
  - Caption: *Governed execution. No hallucinations.*

- **Slide 4:** Properly Factored  
  - Diagram: UI ❌ logic; Logic → Engine  
  - Caption: *Logic belongs in the engine — not in the app.*

## Standard IDE, Language, Deployment  
### Summary
GenAI-Logic is not a proprietary sandbox.  
It is the opposite: everything is generated into **standard Python**,  
executed by a **deterministic rules engine**, and deployed with **standard DevOps**.

You extend it in your IDE, commit to Git, deploy to containers, and operate it like any serious enterprise system.

Human-in-the-loop governance is built in.

## Closing

GenAI-Logic unifies natural-language intent, deterministic logic, probabilistic reasoning, and MCP-based orchestration.

The result is a **Business Logic Agent** — your governed logic appliance — that plugs into your enterprise architecture and makes AI not just powerful, but **safe, explainable, and correct**.

Explore. Build. Automate. Govern.

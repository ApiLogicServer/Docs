!!! pied-piper ":bulb: TL;DR - Is This Like Versata"

      Versata was a major innovator for business rules on J2EE.  We believe GenAI-Logic is a superior approach, because:

      1. **IDE as Studio:** Pre-IDEs, the Versata Studio presented challenges in debugging, source control, etc.  
      
         * ***GenAI-Logic uses your IDE*** (debugger, source control), and deploys with standard containers.
      
      2.  **Open Client:** While rules were effective, some clients found it difficult to achieve the look and feel they desired.  
      
         * In addition to an instant automatic client, ***GenAI-Logic provides open APIs*** that work with any client.

      Versata provided remarkable value, made compelling by "riding the J2EE wave".  Like Versata, GenAI-Logic is riding waves of interest:

      * **GenAI**
      * **MCP**
      * **Vibe**

## Why GenAI

A common project experience is:

* Weeks (or months) to get running screens
* Then, when Business Users explore the screens, it becomes clear there were basic misunderstandings

Which leads to our premise:

1. **Instant screens** (Agile "Working Software"); collaborate, and iterate to ***get the requirements right***
2. Kickstart the project with a **solid backend** - a Database, API and Logic from declarative / Natural Language models

    * Logic in particular is key: security and multi-table derivations / constraints constitute as much as half your project: declarative rules make them 40X more concise  &nbsp; :trophy:

    * The remaining logic is built in your IDE using standard Python, providing the speed and simplicity of AI - including logic - with the flexibility of a framework

&nbsp;

## Life Cycle

As shown in the Life Cycle outline below, this approach is complimentary to your existing UI Dev tools such as UI frameworks or Low Code Screen Painters. 

* In addition to existing UI Dev tools, please explore automation support for [Ontimize](App-Custom-Ontimize-Overview.md){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

As illustrated by the green graphics below, we seek to provide value in the Inception Phase (get the requirements right), and for backend development.

## How does it work

![how does it work](images/web_genai/how-does-it-work.png)

Web/GenAI

1. Uses GenAI APIs to create databases
2. Uses API Logic Server to create projects from databases
3. Provides services to deploy and run the create projects

Gen/AI is used only in step 1, so once created, projects are stable and do not exhibit AI *hallunications*.

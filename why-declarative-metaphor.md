    Think of declarative rules like spreadsheet formulas. You state *what* is true, and the engine keeps all the dependencies consistent.  
    Now imagine a spreadsheet with no formulas — one where an AI rewrites every cell’s logic each time you change something. Even a great model would inevitably miss some dependency paths, because it’s regenerating behavior rather than understanding it.  
    Declarative rules are the formulas; AI is excellent at writing them. The engine ensures they behave correctly every time, and procedural code remains available for the exceptions.

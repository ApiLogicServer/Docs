## Who Gets Value

Per Grant, the basis for business strategy is to understand who would pay, and why.  Some thoughts:

* Corporate Execs (e.g., CIO):

    1. Enable Business Users to explore business ideas

    1. Use these to improve Bus User / IT collaboration

    1. Improve Time to Market

    1. Deliver significantly more systems to support the business, with reduced cost and risk

    1. Technology Independence: future-proofed IT systems that can move to future technologies without re-write

* Key tech companies (e.g., Microsoft, Google, etc) can provide a platform that can:

    1. Enhance leadership in strategic areas of AI, Cloud

    1. Drive Cloud revenue by making it easier for more customers to build more systems

    1. Protect customers’ IT Investment with systems that can be migrated to new technologies (the answer to IBM’s $1Bn failure in the San Francisco project)

* Services Providers (e.g, Accenture):

    1. Lead in the business user enablement market vs. the IT Tech Market, aka the Jim Liddle article

    1. VAR creators (e.g., the next SAP)

    1. Time to Market

    1. Technology Independence (e.g., don’t be Peach Tree whose DOS software did not move to client/server or the web)

    1. Customizable software: enable customers to customize the package with meaningfully reduced time and complicity (unlike SAP)

    1. Participate in a Value Chain, where other VARs can extend your package to provide another revenue source

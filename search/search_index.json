With GenAI, you have a database.</li> <li>Avoids the FrankenPrompt.</li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>For more information, see the FAQs.</p> How Does GenAI - With Microservice Automation - Avoid the FrankenPrompt? <p> GenAI brings well-known value to app development.  It's great for generating code snippets, particularly for driving automation engines, such as sql (e.g., \"create a database...\").  API Logic Server leverages both of these strengths, including GenAI Logic Automation.</p> <p>For large, complex systems (e.g., microservices and their logic), GenAI breaks down -- results can be inconsistent, sometimes wrong, occasionally head-scratching hallunications.</p> <p>Microservice Automation provides the missing pieces: logic, api and app automation engines (analogous to SQL), enabling GenAI to scale up to complex microservice creation, avoiding:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Avoids \"Franken-response\": the last thing you want is for AI to turn your 5 simple rules into 200 lines of code: hard to read, verify correctness, and change.  By contrast, creating declarative rules results in logic that is concise,  understandable, and provides Maintenance Automation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoids the \"Franken-prompt\": in the absence of automation engines, developers are forced into complex prompt engineering, requiring detailed knowledge of the target code.  This defeats the objective of simplicity.</p> </li> </ol> <p>So, Microserve Automation not only leverages the value of GenAI, but enables it to address complex system creation, preserving simplicity.</p>  Doesn't Low Code Make It Fast?  <p></p> <p>Yes, for retrieval-oriented systems.  But, if your system requires update logic, the multi-table derivations and constraints are nearly half the effort -- the iceberg under the surface of the API.  </p> <p>See the screenshot above: Customize the Logic and API.  Logic automation means logic is expressed in spreadsheet-like rules, not code.  These rules are 40X more concise than code, and are extensible with Python.  They are automatically invoked, and are multi-table, multi-field.  </p> <p>So:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Logic automation is required to fulfill the promise of fast.  Without it, your project will simply not get moving.</p> </li> <li> <p>GenAI simplifies database creation.  In the past, Low Code tools have found it challenging to make it easy for users to define foreign keys, indices, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Developers will appreciate that API Logic Server is standards-based - use your own IDE, familiar tools such as source control, etc.</p> </li> </ol> Don't frameworks make it easy to create endpoints? <p> They do.  But a microservice is far more than a single endpoint.  It's a horse of an entirely different feather, requiring:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Filtering, pagination, optimistic locking... for all the tables</p> </li> <li> <p>API design</p> </li> <li> <p>SQLAlchemy models</p> </li> <li> <p>Admin App</p> </li> <li> <p>Update APIs... and their logic</p> </li> </ul> <p>GenAI Microservice Automation does all of this, automatically.

Context Engineering Revision: Subsystem Creation","text":"<p>This app was built across several iterations. Each iteration revealed a specific gap in Context Engineering (CE) \u2014 the curated knowledge given to the AI before generation. The gaps and their fixes are documented below.</p> <p>This was a very interesting joint AI/human design; the approach:</p> <ol> <li>Gen customs_app</li> <li>Ask genned app to compare itself to the reference implementation - see it here - and create a comparison doc</li> <li>Analyze the comparison doc in a long-running manager session in mgr Copilot with full CE (mgr, project, internals)</li> <li>Ask Copilot to Revise CE (in src and venv), and update this document</li> <li>Repeat</li> </ol> <p></p> 1. No GenAI-Logic CE \u2192 poor \"Fat API\" demo architecture \u274c <p></p> <p>The GenAI-Logic Context Engineering (CE) materials were not loaded, so Claude built a working customs application using standard Python code generation.  The starting case was the <code>basic_demo</code> application, which introduced tables we did not need, but did not (we thought) interfere.</p> <p>The result is a good demo: compiles and runs. </p> <p>This was, however, a \"happy accident\", illustrating that AI alone does not deliver an Enterprise-class architecture, as described below.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Demo API (no filtering, pagination, etc) \u2014 No Enterprise-class API with filtering, sorting, pagination, optimistic locking, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unshared, Path-specific logic (Quality Issues) \u2014 Logic embedded in a single path \u2014 not automatically shared across insert/update/delete/FK-change paths.</p> </li> <li> <p>Procedural \u2014 Manual Ordering (with bugs) \u2014 Logic is procedural with explicit ordering. AI uses pattern matching to order execution, which can fail for business logic \u2014 to see the A/B study, click here. This in fact did occur in our example.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p></p> 2. Missing SubSystem CE \u2192 No Rules, Poor Data Model \u274c <p></p> <p>So, we loaded the Context Engineering, and re-built.  Claude produced poor results on two dimensions:</p> <ul> <li>data model errors (non-autonumber primary keys for <code>SurtaxOrder</code> and <code>SurtaxLineItem</code>)</li> <li>business logic still written as procedural code rather than declarative rules</li> </ul> <p>This was because the CE (Context Engineering) was provided for WebGenAI, but not Copilot.  So we created <code>docs/training/subsystem_creation.md</code> with data model and rules training.</p> <p></p> <p></p> 3. Proper app generated correctly from prompt \u2705 <p></p> <p>With the revised CE in place, Claude generated a complete, correct customs application in a single pass: proper autonumber data model, 16 declarative LogicBank rules enforcing all calculations, clean separation between API routing and rule enforcement, and a Behave test suite with requirement-to-rule traceability.  This became our reference implementation.</p> <p>Context Engineering learning compounds. Each prior failure encoded a reusable correction. Any future project that loads this CE material starts at Step 2 \u2014 the failures were compressed into training assets, not wasted effort.</p> <p>What this means for evaluation: The product (GenAI-Logic) provides the architectural value. The process (Context Engineering iteration) determines whether the AI can reach that architecture reliably. Both matter.</p> <p></p> <p></p> 4. Productization revealed `basic_demo` dependence and master/detail prompt omission \u274c <p></p> <p>The 'basic_demo<code>tables were an accidental artifact - we thought.  But when we re-genned using just the clean</code>starter.sqlite`, we got a poor result:</p> <ul> <li>we lost the master/detail structure that had been inferred from <code>basic_demo</code> - this needed to be added to the prompt</li> <li><code>basic_demo</code> also showed several basic logic patterns that we needed to add to the CE, shown below</li> </ul> <p>The study produced several durable CE principles now encoded in Context Engineering ()<code>subsystem_creation.md</code>, <code>logic_bank_api.md</code>, and <code>.copilot-instructions.md</code>):</p> <ul> <li> <p>Reference table default \u2014 flat column + <code>Rule.copy</code>. Versioned child table only when the prompt explicitly mentions <code>effective_date</code>, rate history, or versioning.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Rule.copy</code> is the default for parent-value access (snapshot, safe). <code>Rule.formula</code> is the escalation (live propagation, needed less often).</p> </li> <li> <p>Request Pattern scope \u2014 integration side-effects only (email, Kafka, AI calls). Not for domain data entry where LogicBank rules derive computed columns automatically.</p> </li> <li> <p>Domain insert is the pattern \u2014 direct insert fires all LogicBank rules. No <code>Sys*</code> wrapper needed.</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Create runnable UI\" = seed example data + Admin App at <code>http://localhost:5656</code>. Never a custom HTML page or calculator endpoint.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lookup references use FK integers \u2014 transactional tables store <code>country_origin_id FK \u2192 CountryOrigin.id</code>, not <code>country_of_origin = \"DE\"</code>. FK is what makes <code>Rule.copy</code> traversable; a text code has no relationship.</p> </li> <li> <p>Seed data canonical pattern \u2014 use <code>alp_init.py</code> with Flask context active so LogicBank fires and all computed fields are correct on first load. Never shell heredocs (terminal tool garbles them).</p> </li> <li> <p>Spec = floor, not ceiling \u2014 a column list in a prompt is the minimum anchor the author needed to specify, not a complete design. Apply domain knowledge to flesh out standard fields, constraints, and sums. Prompt author omissions mean \"obvious to them\" \u2014 not \"not required.\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>Just as <code>basic_demo</code> \"polluted\" a clean generation, so did this readme!  The learning: AI is crafty - it will use whatever it can find, so be careful what you leave lying around.  See the front-matter, above.</p> <p></p> 5. Prompt is a floor, not a ceiling \u274c <p></p> <p>As we added promot engineering for the schema, this changed the AI pattern to blind obedience.  For example, roll-up rules and constraints were not added.</p> <p>So, we changed the CE to stipulate that the prompt is a floor, not a ceiling.</p> <p></p> 6. Validation: Iterations Lead to Production-Quality Results \u2705 <p>Each iteration tested against the hand-crafted <code>customs_app</code> (16 rules) as the fixed ground-truth reference.</p> Iteration Key change Rules <code>Rule.copy</code> <code>Rule.constraint</code> Outcome <code>customs_demo_ce_fix</code> Applied Root Cause fixes to CE 10 0 0 Catastrophic failures gone; FK text-code problem remains <code>customs_demo_v2</code> Fixed prompt: FK integers + single <code>province.tax_rate</code> 13 3 \u2705 1 <code>Rule.copy</code> validated; <code>base_duty_rate</code> and constraints still missing <code>customs_demo_v3</code> Added spec=floor principle to CE 11 3 \u2705 1 Generic domain fields restored; domain-specific <code>base_duty_rate</code> cannot be recovered by CE alone New release (<code>customs_demo</code>) Added <code>base_duty_rate</code> and <code>quantity \u00d7 unit_price</code> to prompt explicitly 16 \u2705 1 3 \u2705 Functionally at par with reference \u2014 all constraints, sums, and rates correct <p>The <code>v1a</code> clean-room finding. A final test (<code>customs_demo_v1a</code>) ran the prompt with no <code>customs_demo</code> readme in context. Without the readme acting as a ghost, the result regressed to near-v3 quality \u2014 confirming that the \"new release\" 16-rule win was partially readme-assisted. What the CE alone does reliably produce: header/detail structure, flat reference table design, <code>Rule.copy</code> for duty rate, and <code>alp_init.py</code> Flask-context seed data. Constraints, single-column province, and <code>CountryOrigin</code> FK table require the prompt spec.</p> <p>CE reliability boundary: CE is reliable for what it explicitly encodes. If a structural outcome depends on inference \u2014 from ghost context, readme text, or ambient schema artifacts \u2014 it is non-deterministic and will not reproduce on a clean project. The practical test: can you point to the CE sentence that requires this outcome? If not, the result is fragile.</p> <p>Domain accuracy finding: The clean-room test also caught a factual error in the hand-crafted reference \u2014 <code>customs_app</code> marks Germany, Japan, and China as surtax-applicable. PC 2025-0917 is a targeted US retaliatory levy; only US-origin goods attract the 25% surcharge. The AI, without the reference in context, modeled this correctly. Domain experts reviewing this system should verify country-of-origin applicability against the current PC annex.</p> <p></p> <p>Key Takeaway: GenAI-Logic is a combination of infrastructure (API, Rules Engine), and AI.  Leveraging AI requires Context Engineering.  This can enable major changes without a product re-release, but strong support/background is required.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Customs-readme-full/#3-test-creation-from-rules","title":"3.

A compliance engineer reviews the DSL output, not the implementation it replaced. The review artifact is at the same abstraction level as the business requirement \u2014 1 rule per derivation, not 200 lines of service code tracing execution paths \u2014 which is what makes the review tractable.

Authoring (AI-assisted, human-reviewed) - You express business intent in natural language (via Copilot or any AI assistant) - The AI translates intent into a declarative DSL, under human review - Distills path-dependent logic into data-bound rules (table invariants) for automatic re-use - Resolves ambiguity using schema and relationships (e.g., copy vs reference) - Produces readable rules developers can inspect, edit, debug and version</p> <p>This is where AI helps \u2014 authoring, not execution.</p> <p>2. Engine Initialization (Deterministic analysis) - On startup, the non-RETE rule engine loads all rules - It computes dependencies automatically from Rule types (derivations, constraints, actions) - Execution order is derived once, not from code paths</p> <p>No compilation. No dependencies-from-pattern-matching. No inference from runtime behavior.</p> <p>3. Runtime Enforcement (Commit-time) - Rules execute at transaction commit via SQLAlchemy commit events - All writes \u2014 APIs, workflows, UIs, agents \u2014 pass through the same rule set - Dependencies are already known; execution is automatic and efficient - No rule is \"called.\" No path can bypass enforcement. - Non-RETE optimizations: pruning, adjustment logic, delta-based aggregations - Cascading via old_row tracking - When Order.customer_id changes, adjusts BOTH old and new Customer.balance</p> <p>The Key Developer Insight:</p> <p>You declare invariants on data. You don't wire rules into flows. Invocation is automatic, on commit. The engine enforces them \u2014 everywhere, automatically, at commit.</p> <p>Why Declarative Rules Matter:</p> <p>LogicBank provides 44X code reduction (5 lines vs 220+ procedural) with: - Automatic ordering - add rules anywhere that makes sense, confident they'll run in the right order - Understanding intent - you see WHAT it does (business rules) vs HOW (procedural steps) - Maintenance - no need to find insertion points or trace execution paths</p> <p>Why the Rules Engine is a Correctness Guarantee:</p> <p>The \"2 critical bugs\" that even AI-generated procedural code missed: 1. Changing Order.customer_id - procedural code failed to adjust BOTH the old and new customer balances 2. Changing Item.product_id - procedural code failed to re-copy the unit_price from the new product</p> <p>These bugs illustrate why declarative rules are mandatory, not optional. Even AI-generated procedural code requires explicit handlers for EVERY possible change path. It's easy to miss: - Foreign key changes affecting multiple parents - Transitive dependencies through multiple tables - Where clause conditions that include/exclude rows</p> <p>The rules engine eliminates this entire class of bugs by automatically handling all change paths.</p> <p>The Complete A/B Test:</p> <p>For the full experiment comparing declarative rules vs AI-generated procedural code, including the 2 bugs Copilot missed and the AI's own analysis of why it failed, see: https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/ApiLogicServer-src/blob/main/api_logic_server_cli/prototypes/basic_demo/logic/procedural/declarative-vs-procedural-comparison.md</p>"},{"location":"Eval-copilot-instructions/#discovery-systems","title":"Discovery Systems","text":"<p>IMPORTANT: The project uses automated discovery systems that:</p> <p>Logic Discovery: 1.

However, creating complete sub-systems is less successful, requiring language input for low-level implementation details.  These require substantial skill (e.g., detailed knowledge of a framework), and result in systems that are difficult to maintain.  In short, a failure to communicate.  </p> <p>By introducing high-level business-oriented language, it becomes possible to create complete systems.  API Logic Server uses AI to create complete systems from high-level business logic, without requiring detailed language input.  </p> <p>These systems are then maintained at a high level of abstraction through created executable models.  The resultant systems are easy to maintain, and extend where necessary using standard languages and tools.  This approach is unique in the industry, and has been proven in a wide range of applications.</p> Does GenAI require Microservice Automation? <p>GenAI brings well-known value to app development.  It's great for generating code snippets, including code snippets for driving other sub-systems, such as sql (e.g., \"create a database...\").  API Logic Server leverages both of these strengths.</p> <p>While GenAI is great for driving sub-systems (like sql), it's not appropriate for creating sub-systems.  For example, you would not want to generate a DBMS using GenAI.</p> <p>But what about microservices - APIs, and their logic?  It is like code snippets, or more like a sub-system?  We investigated GenAI API and logic creation, and here's what we found...</p> <p> </p> <p>1. GenAI for APIs</p> <p>It is possible to create rudimentary APIs using GenAI.   However:</p> <ol> <li>Not enterprise-class: the APIs are incomplete or incorrect for required features such as security, fitering, pagination, optimistic locking, etc.  For example, this filtering code only works for the primary key, and pagination is stubbed out:</li> </ol> <pre><code># Endpoint to get customers with filtering and pagination\n@app.route('/customers', methods=['GET'])\ndef get_customers():\n    page = int(request.args.get('page', 1))\n    per_page = int(request.args.get('per_page', 10))\n    query = session.query(Customer)\n    customers = paginate(query, page, per_page).all()\n    return jsonify([{'id': c.id, 'name': c.name, 'email': c.email, 'phone': c.phone} for c in customers])\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Complex: it requires a great deal of prompt engineering to \"program\" the target framework to get a better result.  That requires detailed knowledge of the target -  failure to communicate - defeats the simplicity objective of using GenAI.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>2. GenAI for Logic</p> <p>In most cases, GenAI responses simply ignores the logic requirement.  Attempts to address it fall in 3 categories: triggers, Logic Bank code with no context,  and Logic Bank code with context.</p> <p> </p> <p>2a. Logic: Triggers</p> <p>The trigger solution GenAI response typically looks something like this:</p> <pre><code>-- Note: The enforcement of the Check Credit requirement is complex and might be better handled in application logic.\n-- However, you can create a stored procedure or use triggers to enforce these rules, keeping in mind the performance implications.\n\n-- Example of a trigger to enforce Customer.balance &lt;= credit_limit (simplified version)\nDELIMITER //\nCREATE TRIGGER CheckCreditBeforeCustomerUpdate\nBEFORE UPDATE ON Customers\nFOR EACH ROW\nBEGIN\n    IF NEW.Balance &gt; NEW.Credit_Limit THEN\n        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Customer balance exceeds credit limit.';\n    END IF;\nEND;\n//\nDELIMITER ;\n</code></pre> <p>This is simply not a solution: it does not address the triggering event - some change to the order.  By contrast, our logic automates about a dozen Use Cases, including:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The customer balance is adjusted (and credit is checked) when an order is inserted, deleted, shipped, or re-assigned to a different customer.  Importantly, the logic (and its overhead) is pruned on other changes, such as changing the shipping address.</p> </li> <li> <p>This dependency management chains: the order is adjusted when items are inserted, deleted, or updated with new quantities or different products.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Addressing this level of logic is why rules are 40X more concise than code.</p> <p> </p> <p>2b. Logic: Logic Bank, without context</p> <p>If we engineer our prompt to suggest using Logic Bank (a component of API Logic Server), we get a response like this if there is no project context:</p> <pre><code>def declare_logic():\n    LogicBank.activate(session=session, activator=logic_bank_util.register_rules)\n\n    @LogicBank.rule(\"order\", \"before_flush\")\n    def order_amount_total(row: LogicRow):\n        row.amount_total = sum([item.quantity * item.unit_price for item in row.items])\n\n    @LogicBank.rule(\"customer\", \"before_flush\")\n    def customer_balance(row: LogicRow):\n        row.balance = sum([order.amount_total for order in row.orders if order.date_shipped is None])\n\n    @LogicBank.rule(\"item\", \"before_flush\")\n    def item_amount(row: LogicRow):\n        row.amount = row.quantity * row.unit_price\n\n    @LogicBank.rule(\"item\", \"before_flush\")\n    def copy_unit_price_from_product(row: LogicRow):\n        row.unit_price = row.product.unit_price\n\n    @LogicBank.rule(\"customer\", \"before_flush\")\n    def check_credit_limit(row: LogicRow):\n        if row.balance &gt; row.credit_limit:\n            raise Exception(f\"Customer {row.name}'s balance exceeds their credit limit.\")\n</code></pre> <p>There are no existing Logic Bank APIs remotely like those above.  This code does not even compile, much less run.  It is, as they say, an hallucination.</p> <p> </p> <p>2c. Logic: Logic Bank, With Context</p> <p>Excellent results are obtained when the prompt has available context.  Copilot turns our Natural Language requirements into Logic Bank code, requiring only minor adjustments.</p> <p>And this is far preferable to generating logic code -- it's much better to understand and maintain the 5 rules than the 200 lines of generated code.</p> <p> </p> <p>2d. Conclusion: Abstraction Level is Critical</p> <p>As perhaps expected, large scale sub-system creation from GenAI is not practical.

Declare Logic (from design)","text":"<p>Business Logic is the heart of the system, enforcing our business policies.  Logic consists of multi-table constraints and derivations, and actions such as sending email and messages.  A core Behave objective is to define and test such behavior.</p> <p>It's generally accepted that such domain-specific logic must require domain-specific code.  The problem is that this is:</p> <ul> <li>slow (it's often nearly half the system).</li> <li>opaque to business users.</li> <li>painful to maintain - it's no secret that developers hate maintenance, since it's less coding than \"archaeology\".  A painful amount of time is spent reading the existing code, to understand where to insert the new logic.</li> </ul> <p>Ideally, our logic design is executable. </p> <p>So, API Logic Server provides Logic Automation, where logic is implemented as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Spreadsheet-like rules for multi-table derivations and constraints, and</p> </li> <li> <p>Python, to implement logic not addressed in rules such as sending email or messages</p> </li> </ul> <p>So, instead of several hundred lines of code, we declare 5 rules (more details here).  </p> <p>Rules are entered in Python, with code completion, as shown below.  Observe how they exactly correspond to our design, and are executable by the API Logic Server rules engine:</p> <p></p> <p>Unlike manual code, logic is declarative:</p> <ul> <li>automatically reused - re-use is usually achieved by careful design; rules make re-use automatic:</li> <li>Since rules are about the data (not a specific transaction), they automate all the transactions that touch the data (add order, delete order, change order shipped date, etc).  Even ones you might have overlooked (move order to different customer).</li> <li>Since rules are enforced as part of the API, they are automatically shared across all screens and services.</li> <li>automatically ordered - maintenance is simply altering the rules; the system computes their execution order by automatically discovering their dependencies.  No more archaeology.</li> <li>transparent - business users can read the spreadsheet-like rules.  We'll exploit this in the Behave Logic Report, described below.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Key Takeaway: spreadsheet-like rules can dramatically reduce the effort for backend logic, and make it transparent</p> <p> </p> <p>Key Takeaway: keep your Logic Design high level (what not how -- think spreadsheet), and your design will often map directly to executable rules. </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Logic-Tutorial/#3b-coderun-behave-scenarios","title":"3b.

That's because it's not about writing code, but it's mainly archaeology - deciphering code someone else wrote, just so you can add 4 or 5 lines that will hopefully be called and function correctly.</p> <p>Rules change that, since they self-order their execution (and pruning) based on system-discovered dependencies.  So, to alter logic, you just \"drop a new rule in the bucket\", and the system will ensure it's called in the proper order, and re-used over all the Use Cases to which it applies.  Maintenance is faster, and higher quality. </p> <p>b. Extensibile with Python</p> <p>In this case, we needed to do some if/else testing, and it was convenient to add a pinch of Python.

The deterministic runtime guarantees correctness, order, and safety \u2014 AI speed and simplicity, with engineering discipline.</p> <p>Q: What if my business logic is too complex for a DSL? A: GenAI-Logic supports full Python event hooks, allowing procedural extensions for any edge case.</p> <p>Q: How are rules stored and backed up? A: Rules are standard Python files, versioned in Git with schema and API definitions. Backup and restore use your existing DevOps process \u2014 no special tooling required.</p> <p>Q: How do I debug or audit the system? A: Every rule execution is logged. Developers can step into a rule in their debugger, view dependencies, and trace results. Full transparency \u2014 no \"magic.\"</p> <p>Q: Can I integrate it with my existing APM and observability tools? A: Yes. Standard Python logging and Flask hooks integrate with DataDog, Dynatrace, and Splunk. Rule metrics can be exported for dashboards or alerts.</p> <p>Q: What if I need real-time streaming or orchestration? A: Use event rules (Kafka, webhooks, REST) to integrate with workflow or orchestration systems. GenAI-Logic focuses on data-integrity logic; orchestration remains external.</p> <p>Q: How do I promote and govern rules across environments? A: Because rules are versioned source, promotion is via Git branches or CI/CD. Rule changes can be reviewed, tested, and deployed like any other code.</p> <p>Q: Is this ready for mission-critical scale? A: Yes. The runtime is stateless, containerized, and proven in production-class deployments. It runs efficiently under load because dependency pruning avoids redundant recompute.</p>"},{"location":"Tech-Summary/#the-next-phase-probabilistic-deterministic","title":"The Next Phase: Probabilistic + Deterministic","text":"<p>As AI shifts to agentic systems, enterprises need deterministic rails for reliability.

Ask them to implement a credit check and they'd write: \"When placing an order, multiply price \u00d7 quantity, add to order total, compare to credit limit, reject if exceeded.\"</p> <p>That's path-dependent logic. It solves one use case \u2014 placing an order. Ship an order? Different path, rewrite the logic. Agent updates an order? Another path, another rewrite.

Instead of \"when placing an order, check credit,\" you declare: \"Customer balance is always the sum of unpaid orders and must never exceed the credit limit.\"</p> <p>That's it. One rule.
